# Building the code
Important: When creating a new file, make sure you add it's input and output to rollup! (`rollup.config.js`)  
Run `npm install` to get rollup and it's dependancies.  
We use rollup to build and minify the files.   
When you want to build run `npm start` or `npm run build` which will write the build files to the `dist` folder.
